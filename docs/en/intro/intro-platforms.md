# Ubuntu Core IoT Platforms


There are several hardware platforms that run Ubuntu Core with snaps. Each has
a pre-built reference image that you are able to get started with right now.
This section describes each and points you to more information on getting started
with these. These reference platforms/Ubuntu Core images are meant to get you
started evaluating and working with Ubuntu Core as quickly and inexpensively as
possible. If a particular reference platform matches your own use cases, you may
take these Canonical-provided images and customize them for your purposes.

The following table shows the reference hardware platforms that run
Ubuntu Core and use snaps:


| Platform Name         | Hardware Description                         |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Raspberry Pi 2        | ARM H2 Quad-core Cortex-A7 64-bit CPU <br> 256/512 MB of RAM <br> No built-in flash storage |
| Raspberry Pi 3         | Broadcom BCM2837 4x ARM Cortex-A53 64-bit CPU<br>1 GB of RAM<br>No built-in flash storage|
| Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3 | Broadcom BCM2837 4x ARM Cortex-A53 64-bit CPU<br>1 GB of RAM<br>No built-in flash storage |
| Orange Pi Zero         | ARM H2 Quad-core Cortex-A7 64-bit CPU<br>256/512 MB of RAM<br>No built-in flash storage |
| Qualcomm Snapdragon 410c | ARM Quad-core Cortex A53 64-bit CPU<br>1 GB of RAM<br>8 GB eMMC on-board flash storage |
| Intel NUC             | Intel Core i3, i5, i7 64-bit CPU<br>Up to 32 GB of RAM<br>No built-in flash storage |
| Samsung Artik 5       | ARM Dual/Quad Core Cortex-A7 64-bit CPU<br>512 MB/1 GB of RAM<br>4 GB eMMC on-board flash storage |
| Samsung Artik 10      | ARM Quad Cortex-A15 + quad Cortex-A7 64-bit CPU<br>2 GB of RAM<br>16 GB eMMC on-board flash storage |
| KVM                   | Full x86 32/64 bit CPI software virtualization platform|

There are official images produced by Canonical for these specific hardware
platforms. Also, Ubuntu community members work with and produce images for
other platforms and CPUs. Refer to these individual projects for more information
on what other unofficial images might work for your use cases.
