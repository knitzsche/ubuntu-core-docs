#Getting around

Welcome to Ubuntu IoT Developer documentation. 

These pages cover the core set of platform and service technologies that make up Ubuntuâ€™s Internet of Things (IoT) offering, addressing how Ubuntu operating systems and technologies deliver a smooth, updatable and secure solution for IoT its dsistributors. 

This documentation is just one part of the wide world of Ubuntu documentation. 

## Snapcraft for packaging

Note particularly that Ubuntu for IoT depends on [Snapcraft](https://docs.snapcraft.io/), the elegant tool for packaging softrware into Snaps. For ongoing Snacraft design and discussion, see the [snapcraft forum topic](https://forum.snapcraft.io/c/snapcraft). 

Snapcraft source is [here](https://github.com/snapcore/snapcraft). Participation at all levels is always welcome. 

## The Snapd daemon

The Snapd daemon is the heart of all snap systems, and is the key technology that enables Ubuntu for IoT. See the [forum topic](https://forum.snapcraft.io/c/snapd) for ongoing discussions of snapd design, the roadmap, and for lively and in-depth communciations with Snapd developers, users, and the community.

Check out the [Snapd source code](https://github.com/snapcore/snapd), and get involved!
