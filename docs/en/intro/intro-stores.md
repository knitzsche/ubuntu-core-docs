# Snap Stores

Snap Stores deliver software unattended to any system with snapd: Ubuntu Core, classic Ubuntu or most Linux distributions. When a new snap revision is published in a Snap Store, snap systems learn about it (following their own schedules), and they install the new revision, leaving the previous snap revision on disk (to speed rollback, just in case that is needed).

No additional management software is needed: it's automatic and built in, with all the controls and efficientices needed for deployments from large to small. 

# Global Snap Store

The *global* Snap store is free and open to publish in and to install from (all you need to publish there is an [Ubuntu SSO account](login.ubuntu.com)). Stock Ubuntu Core and classic Ubuntu systems all use the global Snap Store. Check it [out](https://snapcraft.io/store). 

# Brand Snap Stores

Brand Snap Stores enable commercial and protected snap software distribution. Brands can privately publish snaps in Brand Stores. And, only authenticated Brand systems can install them.

Through various Snap Store inclusion techniques, Brands can curate sets of snaps to meet the precise needs of your Brand devices and solutions. Brand Stores can include all snaps in the global Store, or just selected global snaps.

Brand Stores enable such powerful features as Snapd Interface Autoconnection, even for the most powerful interfaces, thus giving Brands authority and control over their fleets beyond that available to stock devices.

Brand Stores are feature rich to support Brand based commercial deployements, including revision control, snap review before release, role-based access and use-cases, ann more
