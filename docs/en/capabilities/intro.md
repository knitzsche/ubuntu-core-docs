# Introduction

Many functions and features can be added to an Ubuntu Core system by adding snaps. 

This section explores some of the snaps that provide a wide range of commonly used features.

These snaps are well tested in various commercial offerings and are actively maintained by an internal Canonical team.

**Note**:Some snaps and snap combinations may require some additional integration work.

## Testing frameworks

Manual and automatic testing frameworks:
 
- [Plainbox](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/plainbox)
- [Spread](https://github.com/snapcore/spread)
