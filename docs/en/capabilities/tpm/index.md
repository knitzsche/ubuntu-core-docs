# Trusted Platform Module (TPM)

There are currently two different snaps that help manage TPM under Ubuntu Core Stacks
depending on the version of TPM that your hardware device supports:

* tpm
* tpm2

[See this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module) for more
information about TPM.
